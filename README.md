Hey there :)
These codes are some college projects that I made, and soon I'll put some of my own projects here, but I have no time on this second half of 2019.
But maybe, later this year I'll post my first one, idk lul.
Oh, and all of them are in pt-BR.

The "Legends of Coreth" is a text-based game that changes the story based on your choices.
And the "Joguinho de Azar (kinda)" is a little game that you can play on that boring day and have some fun :)
